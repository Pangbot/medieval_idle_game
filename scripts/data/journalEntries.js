        I was tinkering with my time machine and... well now I'm stuck here. Wherever - and whenever - this is. I went through the standard checks.

        Environment: Earth-like gravity, low-none radiation levels, breathable air.
        Sun-like star: Present. 
        Natural satellites: Earth-like Moon, (still) intact.
        Local flora: Earth-like. Seems like I'm in some kind of forest. 
        Local fauna: Primarily Earth-like insects, some Earth-like rodents, noises suggest larger mammal-like animals in the vicinity.
        Best estimate of location: Hopefully Earth. If so, the types of trees I can see makes me think I'm somewhere in northern Europe.
        Best estimate of time: The star's pretty high in the sky, probably around halfway through a day here.
        Best estimate of date: If I'm on Earth then it's a rabbit I saw earlier, and the Moon hasn't been shattered, so... somewhere between a few million years ago and 2118 AD. If I'm not on Earth, I can't even begin to guess.
        Short term goal: Locate (or construct) shelter, secure food and fresh water.
        Long term goal: Assume for now that I'm on Earth and refine my date estimate. 
        Comments: If I'm not on Earth, I'll at least die having discovered the most habitable extrasolar planet to date. If I'm on Earth, I can only hope humans are around in some capacity.
        
        All those years ahead of me and now I'm stuck in this trash heap? I've barely had a chance to truly live and now this is what I have to put up with?
        You know what? Screw that. I'm getting back. 
        If this is Earth, I can find iron, copper, all sorts. It doesn't matter how long it takes if I never came here in the first place.
        But first things first, better make sure I survive the night.`

        It felt like I was just getting started in life. All those years in education, trying to get a good job, finding a partner. Wasted.

        It's been a good run, I suppose. Can't be too upset... I think.
        How long will it be until I miss my spouse? Forget them? My children? My friends? My pets?
