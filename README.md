What if you were sent back to Medieval times armed with only your current knowledge? Could you "pre-invent" anything useful? Could you navigate daily life? Could you even survive?

Back to the Present is a "Progress Knight" style idle game. You are from the distant future where time machines are commonplace. Due to a malfunction with yours, you're stranded in England in the year 1500. If you can make your way back to your present, you can prevent this mishap from happening in the first place. (Don't worry, the Universe smooths out the paradox)

All you need to do is make a time machine... in a time where there was no:
Tachyon harvester (invented 2118)
Computation
Ability to harness electricity
Mass-produced machinery
Scientific Method

Hm, 40 years may not be enough for this. That's if some plague doesn't get you first. That being said, where are you going to sleep tonight? Where's your next meal coming from? You need to actually survive as well. You remember how to make penicillin, right? Or paracetamol?

Worse comes to worst, you could always journal your life. With enough luck, your future (past?) self will read it and you'll give yourself a leg up for the next go around.
